# Assumptions

### Basic Assumptions
- The storage tank is a perfect cylinder.


### Thermodynamic Assumptions
- The tank is in thermal equalibrium.
- All energy from the sun is transferred into the panel.
- The simulation starts such that the hydronic components are in thermal equalibrium with the ambient temperature of its surrounding (panel = outside air, and tank = indoor air).

### Operational Assumptions
- The pump is sized such that it can overcome the system head and produce the constant flow defined.
- The speed of the pump is constant and instantaneous.
