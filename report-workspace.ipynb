Is the goal of the data analysis to find deficiencies/inaccuracies in the model, or to pretend as though this is real building data and provide insight into operation, energy usage, system parameters (temps, flows)? What format should the deliverable be, a static PDF like report,  a dynamic dashboard? Are there specific tools or software packages he'd like to see showcased? \n",

    "3/4. No specific preference. PDF would be enough for report. But if [you would] like, adding a dynamic dashboard will be useful.\""
